# Frontend

Next.js-based specialist portal used to triage incoming consults, review AI summaries, and experiment with conversational control.

## Getting Started

```
cd frontend/portal
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the portal. The mock data layer in `lib/mockData.ts` should be replaced once the backend API is available.
